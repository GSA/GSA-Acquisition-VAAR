When the VA Rule of Two (see 802.101) is met:

         <p class="p List2">(1) The set-aside requirements as provided in 819.7006 and 819.7007 are mandatory.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The requirements in FAR 8.405-1, 8.405-2, and 8.405-3 apply, except only quotes received from verified (<em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> VIP-listed) and eligible SDVOSBs or VOSBs will be considered.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The eligibility requirements of 819.7003, 819.7006, and 819.7007 apply, including the requirement for offerors to be VIP-listed at the time they submit offers/quotes as well as at the time awards are made.

         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">When market research does not support set-asides.</em> Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8128 and to the extent that market research does not support an SDVOSB or VOSB set-aside in either FSS or the open market, the contracting activity shall give priority in the award of orders placed under this part to VIP-listed SDVOSBs/VOSBs through the use of evaluation preferences giving priority to SDVOSBs first, then to a lesser extent VOSBs, and finally to any firm that proposes to use SDVOSBs/VOSBs as subcontractors. Contracting officers must use the clause prescribed in 808.405-570(b).
</p>
