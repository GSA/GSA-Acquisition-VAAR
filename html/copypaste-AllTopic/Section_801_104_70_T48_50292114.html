			To secure health-care resources which otherwise might not be feasibly available, or to effectively utilize certain other health-care resources, the VA may, when the VA determines it to be in the best interest of the prevailing standards of the Department medical care program, make arrangements, by contract or other form of agreement for the mutual use, or exchange of use, of health-care resources between Department health-care facilities and any health-care provider, or other entity or individual.
