      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) The following principles apply to VA acquisitions under this subpart:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Before setting aside or reserving an acquisition for small businesses under FAR subpart 19.5, contracting officers shall refer to 808.002 and 819.203-70 and subpart <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="Subpart_819_70_T48_50212197.html#Subpart_819_70_T48_50212197">819.70</a> for VA SDVOSB/VOSB priorities and preferences.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Set-asides under the Veterans First Contracting Program in subpart <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="Subpart_819_70_T48_50212197.html#Subpart_819_70_T48_50212197">819.70</a> (see 819.7006 and 819.7007) have precedence over other small business set-asides authorized in FAR part 19, both above and below the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT). An SDVOSB/VOSB set-aside satisfies the legislative requirement to reserve actions below the SAT for small business.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(d), set-asides for SDVOSBs/VOSBs are mandatory whenever a contracting officer has a reasonable expectation of receiving two or more offers/quotes from eligible, capable and verified firms, and that an award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the Government. (VA Rule of Two (see 802.101))
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The set-aside principles in this section apply to VA acquisitions even when a procuring activity is meeting its goals or is planning the use of an interagency agreement, Federal Supply Schedule, or a multiple award contract, including a Governmentwide contract vehicle.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The requirements in this section apply to all VA acquisitions under this subpart, including reserves, orders, and BPAs under multiple award contracts, GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts, and Multi-Agency Contracts (MACs) awarded by another agency. A set-aside restricted to SDVOSBs/VOSBs pursuant to subpart <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="Subpart_819_70_T48_50212197.html#Subpart_819_70_T48_50212197">819.70</a> satisfies competition requirements in FAR part 6, as well as fair opportunity requirements for orders under multiple-award contracts (see FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F)).
