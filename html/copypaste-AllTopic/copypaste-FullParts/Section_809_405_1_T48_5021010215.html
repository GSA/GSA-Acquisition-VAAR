Examples of factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, potential costs associated with a termination, possible disruption to VA program objectives, and integrity of VA acquisition programs.

The HCA or their designee must make a written determination of the compelling reasons in accordance with FAR 9.405-1(b). Compelling reasons for the purposes of FAR 9.405-1(b) include, but are not limited to, urgency of the need for new or continued work, lengthy time period to acquire the new work from other sources and meeting estimated quantity for requirements contracts.
