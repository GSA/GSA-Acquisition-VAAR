</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) If the offeror is required to submit an individual subcontracting plan, the minimum goals for award of subcontracts to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns and veteran-owned small business concerns shall be at least commensurate with the Department's annual service-disabled veteran-owned small business and veteran-owned small business prime contracting goals for the total dollars planned to be subcontracted.

                                 <p class="p List1">(d) To be credited toward goal achievements, businesses must be verified as eligible in the Vendor Information Pages database.
