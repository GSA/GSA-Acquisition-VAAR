</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The contract work involves a risk of an unusually hazardous nature.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The losses or liability arise out of the direct performance of the contract.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The losses or liability are not covered by the financial protection required under 828.7002.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The Government may indemnify a contractor for liability (including reasonable expenses of litigation or settlement) to third persons for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property from a risk that the contract defines as unusually hazardous. The indemnification will not cover liability under State or Federal worker's injury compensation laws to employees of the contractor who are both:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Employed at the site of the contract work; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Working on the contract for which indemnification is granted.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) The Government may indemnify the contractor for loss of or damage to property of the contractor from a risk that the contract defines as unusually hazardous.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) A contract that provides for indemnification in accordance with this subpart must also require that:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The contractor must notify the contracting officer of any claim or suit against the contractor for death, bodily injury, or loss of or damage to property; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The Government may choose to control or assist in the defense of any suit or claim for which indemnification is provided in the contract. (38 U.S.C. 7317)
