         <p class="p List1">(a) A contracting officer may award contracts to VOSB concerns on a sole source basis provided:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $5 million;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The requirement is synopsized in accordance with FAR part 5;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The VOSB concern has been determined to be a responsible contractor with respect to performance;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Award can be made at a fair and reasonable price; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) No responsible SDVOSB concern has been identified.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The contracting officer's determination whether to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer. A determination that only one VOSB concern is available to meet the requirement is not required.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) When conducting a VOSB sole source acquisition, the contracting officer shall ensure businesses are registered and verified as eligible in the VIP database prior to making an award.
