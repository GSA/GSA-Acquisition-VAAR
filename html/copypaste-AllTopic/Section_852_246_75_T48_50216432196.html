</p>
                                 <p class="p P">Should the Contractor fail to complete the work or fail to proceed promptly to provide guarantee period services after notification by the Contracting Officer, the Government may, subject to the default clause contained at FAR 52.249-10, Default (Fixed-Price Construction), and after allowing the Contractor 10 days to correct and comply with the contract, terminate the right to proceed with the work (or the separable part of the work) that has been delayed or unsatisfactorily performed. In this event, the Government may take over the work and complete it by contract or otherwise, and may take possession of and use any materials, appliances, and plant on the work site necessary for completing the work. The Contractor and its sureties shall be liable for any damages to the Government resulting from the Contractor's refusal or failure to complete the work within this specified time, whether or not the Contractor's right to proceed with the work is terminated. This liability includes any increased costs incurred by the Government in completing the work. </p>
