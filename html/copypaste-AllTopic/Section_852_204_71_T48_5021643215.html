</p>
                                 <p class="p Runin List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Access to VA information and VA information systems.</em>

			Contractors are limited in their request for logical or physical access to VA information or VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, third parties and business associates to the extent necessary to perform the services or provide the goods as specified in the contracts, agreements, task, delivery or purchase orders.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(2) All Contractors, subcontractors, third parties, and business associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) HIPAA Business Associate Agreement requirement. Contractors shall enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with VHA, VA's Covered Entity, when contract requirements and access to protected health information is required and when requested by the Contracting Officer, or the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (see VAAR 824.103-70). Under the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, a Covered Entity (VHA) must have a satisfactory assurance that its PHI will be safeguarded from misuse. To do so, a Covered Entity enters into a BAA with a contractor (now the business associate), which obligates the business associate to only use the Covered Entity's PHI for the purposes for which it was engaged, provide the same protections and safeguards as is required from the Covered Entity, and agree to the same disclosure restrictions to PHI that is required of the Covered Entity in situations where a contractor - 
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(i) Creates, receives, maintains, or transmits VHA PHI or that will store, generate, access, exchange, process, or utilize such PHI in order to perform certain health care operations activities or functions on behalf of the Covered Entity; or

                                 <p class="p List3">(ii) Provides one or more of the services specified in the Privacy Rule to or for the Covered Entity.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List4">(A) Contractors or entities required to execute BAAs for contracts and other agreements become VHA business associates. BAAs are issued by VHA or may be issued by other VA programs in support of VHA. The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires VHA to execute compliant BAAs with persons or entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit VHA PHI or that will store, generate, access, exchange, process, or utilize such PHI in order to perform certain activities, functions or services to, for, or on behalf of VHA. There may be other VA components or staff offices which also provide certain services and support to VHA and must receive PHI in order to do so. If these components award contracts or enter into other agreements, purchase/delivery orders, modifications and issue governmentwide purchase card transactions to help in the delivery of these services to VHA, they will also fall within the requirement to obtain a satisfactory assurance from these contractors by executing a BAA.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List4">(B) BAA requirement flow down to subcontractors. A prime Contractor required to execute a BAA shall also obtain a satisfactory assurance, in the form of a BAA, that any of its subcontractors who will also create, receive, maintain, or transmit VHA PHI or that will store, generate, access, exchange, process, or utilize such PHI will comply with HIPAA requirements to the same degree as the Contractor. Contractors employing a subcontractor who creates, receives, maintains, or transmits VHA PHI or that will store, generate, access, exchange, process, or utilize such VHA PHI under a contract or agreement is required to execute a BAA with each of its subcontractors which also obligates the subcontractor (<em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> also a business associate) to provide the same protections and safeguards and agree to the same disclosure restrictions to VHA's PHI that is required of the Covered Entity and the prime Contractor.

If such services are proposed to be performed outside the continental United States, and are not otherwise disallowed by other Federal law, regulations or policy, or other VA policy or other mandates as stated in the contract, specifications, statement of work or performance work statement (including applicable Business Associate Agreements), the Contractor/subcontractor must state in its proposal where all non-U.S. services are provided. At a minimum, the Contractor/subcontractor must include a detailed Information Technology Security Plan, for review and approval by the Contracting Officer, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, and data protection.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Contractor/subcontractor employee reassignment and termination notification.</em> Contractors and subcontractors shall provide written notification to the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) immediately, and not later than four (4) hours, when an employee working on a VA information system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the Contractor or subcontractor's employment on the cognizant VA contract.

VA reserves the right to conduct scheduled or unscheduled on-site inspections, assessments, or audits of Contractor and subcontractor IT resources, information systems and assets to ensure data security and privacy controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with Federal and VA requirements. The Contractor and subcontractor will provide all necessary access and support to VA and/or GAO staff during periodic control assessments or audits.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Data retention, destruction, and contractor self-certification.</em> The Contactor and its subcontractors are responsible for collecting and destroying any VA data provided, created, or stored under the terms of this contract, to a point where VA data or materials are no longer readable or reconstructable to any degree, in accordance with VA Directive 6371, Destruction of Temporary Paper Records, or subsequent issue.

Items returned will be hand carried, securely mailed, emailed, or securely electronically transmitted to the Contracting Officer or to the address as provided in the contract or by the assigned COR, and/or accompanying BAA. Depending on the method of return, Contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information, when permitted by the contract using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, validated under Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-3 (or its successor). If mailed, Contractor/subcontractor must send via a trackable method (USPS, UPS, Federal Express, etc.) and immediately provide the Contracting Officer with the tracking information. No information, data, documentary material, records or equipment will be destroyed unless done in accordance with the terms of this contract and the VHA Records Control Schedule 10-1.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(5) <em class="ph i">Use of VA data and information.</em> The Contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(6) <em class="ph i">Copying VA data or information.</em> The Contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the contract or to preserve electronic information stored on Contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the Contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(7) <em class="ph i">Violation of information custodial requirements.</em> If VA determines that the Contractor has violated any of VA's information confidentiality, privacy, or security provisions, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the Contractor or third-party or terminate the contract for default in accordance with FAR part 49 or terminate for cause in accordance with FAR 12.403.
