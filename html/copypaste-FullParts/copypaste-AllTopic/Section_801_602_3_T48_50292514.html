				</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) 
			through (b)(3) of this section. The specified approval authorities may not be re-delegated.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) At field facilities, for supplies, services (except leases of real property), and construction, the approving authority for unauthorized commitments made by staff assigned to a field facility is the HCA.

The approving authority for unauthorized commitments made by staff assigned to any other organization within VACO is the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) For unauthorized commitments for leasehold interest in real property, the approving authority is:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The Director, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, for unauthorized commitments for 1-5,000 square feet of space or for 1-100 parking spaces costing less than $50,000 per annum.

</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The individual who made the unauthorized commitment will furnish the contracting officer with all records and documents concerning the commitment and a complete written statement of facts that includes the following:
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Why the procurement office was not used.
</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Why the proposed contractor was selected.

</p>
         <p class="p List3">(viii) The name of the individual responsible for the unauthorized commitment.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The contracting officer will review the file and forward it to the approving authority specified in paragraph (b) of this section with any comments or information that the approving authority should consider in evaluating the request for ratification. If the approving authority determines that a legal review would be desirable, the approving authority will coordinate the request for ratification with OGC or the Regional Counsel, as appropriate.
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) If the approving authority authorizes the ratification, the approving authority will return the file to the contracting officer for issuance of a purchase order or contract, as appropriate.
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) If an otherwise proper contract award exceeds the limits of the contracting officer's delegated authority, the ratifying contracting officer must comply with the above requirements and the approving authority must inform the HCA. The HCA will take action to preclude future instances of such awards.
